# Web Browser
Club Penguin was made with Flash, all modern web browsers don't run flash content at all due to the Flash kill switch in 2020.

You need a browser extension like Ruffle, or a old browser version that can run flash like Flashpoint Navigator Component.

You also need to set your browser proxy setting to 127.0.0.1 with the port 22500.
