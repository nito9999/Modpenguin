# Web Browser
**Club Penguin was made with Flash. All modern web browsers don't run Flash content at all due to the Flash kill switch in 2020.**

You need a browser extension like Ruffle, or an old browser version that can run Flash, like Flashpoint Navigator Component.

You also need to set your browser proxy setting to 127.0.0.1 with the port 22500.
